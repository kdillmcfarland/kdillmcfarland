### Greetings! ðŸ‘‹

I am a Senior Bioinformatician at the U. of Washington, School of Medicine in Seattle, WA. I work at the intersection of microbiology and computer science, applying computational approaches to biological problems. Using sequencing and other high-throughput techniques, I research how the human immune system responds to diseases like tuberculosis and asthma. I also teach data science workshops for my department as well as more formally through [R-ladies](https://rladiesseattle.org/) and [the Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/).
